# NLPexam
Hello Professor Strapparava, this is my code for NLP analysis and Models training.
The main codes are SpeechDiarization.py and NLPanalysis.py which also contains the Random Forest training.
The codes wirh Bert in the name are my trial to process the data with different Bert models.
The code in "topic" show the process by which I gathered NL information about each set "Antisocial" and "Normotype" for the comparisons I included in the Latex.
