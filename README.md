# NLPexam
Hello Professor Strapparava, this is my code for NLP analysis and Models training.
The main codes are SpeechDiarization.py and NLPanalysisAndRandomForest.

The codes wirh Bert in the name are my trial to process the data with different Bert models.
MainTopics.py shows the topics of each subset ("Antisocial" and "Normotype").
SingleClassesNLP.py gathers NLP information about each subset.

I attach the final dataset and the material I obtained by Speech Diarization.

The raw audio files are available at: https://we.tl/t-tK2yH9YAK6, don't hesitate to ask me to upload them again if they expire.

Thank you for everything,

Diego
