Hello Professor Strapparava, these are my codes for linguistics analysis and Models training.
The main codes are SpeechDiarization.py and NLPanalysisAndRandomForest.py.

The codes with Bert in the name are my trial to process the data with different Bert models.
MainTopics.py shows the topics of each subset ("Antisocial" and "Normotype").
SingleClassesNLP.py gathers linguistics information about each subset.

POSrandomforest.py contains the model training including POS analysis.

I attach the final dataset and the material I obtained from Speech Diarization.

The raw audio files are available at: https://we.tl/t-tK2yH9YAK6, don't hesitate to ask me to upload them again if they expire.

Thank you for everything,

Diego
